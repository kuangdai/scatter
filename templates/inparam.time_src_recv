# parameters for time, source and stations
# NOTE:
# a) angles are measured in degrees and distances in kilometers
# b) string-typed parameters (except file names) are case insensitive
# c) bool-typed parameters can be specified by 1/0, true/false, yes/no and on/off
# d) prefix of input files is path_of_executable/input/
# e) ParSeries is a series of parameters concatenated by '$', e.g., "s40rts$0.2"



# ================================ time ================================
# WHAT: enforced time step
# TYPE: real
# NOTE: deltaT will be computed automatically if TIME_DELTA_T <= 0.0
TIME_DELTA_T                                0.0

# WHAT: factor of time step
# TYPE: real
# NOTE: multiply the time step (computed or enforced) by this factor
TIME_DELTA_T_FACTOR                         1.0

# WHAT: record length in seconds
# TYPE: real
# NOTE: the actual simulation time will be slightly longer than the
#       specified record length depending on the source time function   
TIME_RECORD_LENGTH                          __LENGTH__



# ================================ source ================================
# WHAT: source type
# TYPE: earthquake / point_force
SOURCE_TYPE                                 earthquake

# WHAT: source file
# TYPE: string (path to file)
# NOTE: the file format for "earthquake" and "point_force" is CMTSOLUTION
SOURCE_FILE                                 CMTSOLUTION

# WHAT: source time function
# TYPE: erf / gauss / ricker
SOURCE_TIME_FUNCTION                        erf

# WHAT: half duration of source time function
# TYPE: real
# NOTE: Use a zero half duration so that the synthetics can be convolved
#       with any source time function after the simulation;
#       The half duration in CMTSOLUTION is not used.
SOURCE_STF_HALF_DURATION                    __HALF_DURATION__



# ================================ stations ================================
# WHAT: file of stations
# TYPE: string (path to file)
# NOTE: Line format -- name network latitude longitude elevation depth [dump_strain]
#       * The "elevation" (5th column) is NEVER used in AxiSEM3D because it is redundant.
#         The actual elevation of a station is determined by topography and its depth.
#       * The "depth" column should be given in meters instead of km.
#       * If "dump_strain" is appended after "depth", the strain at this station will be
#         computed and dumped. Strain components: [RR, TT, ZZ, TZ, RZ, RT] (Voigt rule)
#       Use "none" if no station presents.
OUT_STATIONS_FILE                           STATIONS

# WHAT: coordinate system used in OUT_STATIONS_FILE
# TYPE: geographic / source-centered
# NOTE: geographic      -- name network latitude longitude elevation depth [dump_strain]
#       source-centered -- name network distance azimuth elevation depth [dump_strain]
# the column "elevation" is not used in AxiSEM3D but must be presented in each line
# if "dump_strain" is appended, strain will be dumped in addition to displacement 
OUT_STATIONS_SYSTEM                         geographic

# WHAT: if duplicated stations (network + name) are found in OUT_STATIONS_FILE
# TYPE: ignore / rename / error
# NOTE: ignore -- take the first and ignore the rest duplications
#       rename -- rename the duplicated stations
#       error  -- raise an error and terminate the simulation
OUT_STATIONS_DUPLICATED                     rename

# WHAT: seismogram format
# TYPE: ascii / netcdf / netcdf_no_assemble
# NOTE: may be one or both of the two options
#       * Do not use ascii if the number of stations exceeds/approximates 
#         the open-files limit on you OS (find it with "ulimit -n").
#       * If serial NetCDF library is used, the processors dump synthetics to individual 
#         NetCDF files named axisem3d_synthetics.nc.rankXXXX (XXXX = processor rank),
#         each containing part of the stations. The complete NetCDF file containing all 
#         stations, named axisem3d_synthetics.nc, will be assembled after the time loop.
#       * Assembling axisem3d_synthetics.nc.rankXXXX can be time-consuming for a large 
#         number of stations, which can be avoided by using netcdf_no_assemble.
#         A file named station_rank.txt will be provided to locate stations on ranks.  
#       * If parallel NetCDF library is used, all processors dump directly into 
#         axisem3d_synthetics.nc during the time loop. 
#       * Use python_tools/nc2ascii.py to convert axisem3d_synthetics.nc
#         into ascii format. 
#       * Use python_tools/asdf/nc2asdf.py to convert axisem3d_synthetics.nc
#         into the ASDF format (https://seismic-data.org/). 
OUT_STATIONS_FORMAT                         ascii

# WHAT: seismogram components
# TYPE: RTZ / ENZ / SPZ
# NOTE: RTZ -- radial, transverse, vertical (source-centered)
#       ENZ -- east, north, vertical (geographic)
#       SPZ -- s, phi, z (cylindrical, solver-inherent)
OUT_STATIONS_COMPONENTS                     RTZ

# WHAT: interval for seismogram sampling
# TYPE: integer
# NOTE: Time steps in between are ignored. We strongly discourage a sparse sampling
#       at simulation stage and suggest OUT_STATIONS_RECORD_INTERVAL = 1.
OUT_STATIONS_RECORD_INTERVAL                1

# WHAT: interval to dump buffers to files
# TYPE: integer
# NOTE: set this to some large number to avoid frequent I/O access
OUT_STATIONS_DUMP_INTERVAL                  1000

# WHAT: whether to save wavefield on the surface
# TYPE: bool
# NOTE: * Having the whole wavefield on the surface, one can extract synthetics
#         at any unburied receiver locations after the simulation, using the
#         provided script python_tools/surface2stations.py.
#       * parameters OUT_STATIONS_RECORD_INTERVAL and OUT_STATIONS_DUMP_INTERVAL 
#         still apply to this option.
OUT_STATIONS_WHOLE_SURFACE                  false

# WHAT: buried depth measured in reference spherical model
# TYPE: bool
# NOTE: false -- buried depth measured in physical undulated model
#       true  -- buried depth measured in reference spherical model
OUT_STATIONS_DEPTH_REF                      false
